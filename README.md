# üéÆ 2048 Game in C++ with AI

This project implements the classic **2048 game** in C++ with modular design and AI functionality. The game uses **PDCurses** for terminal-based UI and supports both manual gameplay and AI-driven automation.

## üöÄ Features

### üéÆ Classic Gameplay
- **Sliding Tiles**: Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` or arrow keys to move tiles.
- **Undo Support**: Undo the last move for better strategy.
- **Dynamic Grid Size**: Play with grids of size 4x4, 5x5, or 6x6.
- **Hints**: Use AI to suggest the best move for your current state.
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the current and best scores.

### ü§ñ AI Mode
- Predicts up to **three steps ahead** to evaluate the best moves.
- Heuristic evaluation based on:
  - **Score Maximization**: Prioritizes moves that yield the highest score.
  - **Empty Tiles**: Keeps more open spaces for survivability.
  - **Monotonicity**: Encourages a smooth tile arrangement for easier merging.
  - **Merge Potential**: Favors moves that create larger tiles.
- Fully autonomous gameplay.

# üõ†Ô∏è Key Components

## Game Mechanics
- **Tile Movement**:
  - Implements `moveUp`, `moveDown`, `moveLeft`, and `moveRight` functions.
- **Random Tile Addition**:
  - Adds a `2` (90%) or `4` (10%) tile to empty cells after every move.
- **Grid Display**:
  - Uses PDCurses to dynamically render the game grid with colorful tiles.

## AI Logic
- **Heuristic-based evaluation function**:
  1. **Score**: Prefers moves with higher immediate scores.
  2. **Empty Tiles**: Prioritizes moves that free up space.
  3. **Monotonicity**: Encourages tile ordering for easier merges.
  4. **Merge Potential**: Favors moves with high merging opportunities.
- **Three-move prediction**:
  - Evaluates up to three moves ahead to select the most optimal path.
